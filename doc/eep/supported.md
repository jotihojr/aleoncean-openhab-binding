# Teach-in

## remote device, send data

To communicate with this remote device, a teach-in is required so the remote device(receiver) reacts to signals from the USB300/EnOcean-Pi modules.

To perform a teach-in, you have to reset the receiver (eg. Smart-Plug) to clear all old communication partners. After that, you have to set your receiver into teach-in mode (read the manual of your device for instructions). Notice: Many devices have different teach-in modes, read your manual carefully. After a short time, your USB300/EnOcean-Pi modules(sender) should send a package to the receiver which causes the receiver to authorize the sender to send commands to the receiver.

The most devices handle the teach-in in the following way:
When in teach-in mode, the receiver will listen for all incoming telegrams. The Sender-ID of an arriving telegram (in this case sent from your sender module) is interpreted as an authorized information source. After that, every telegram with the authorized Sender-ID will be accepted and commands will be executed.

Other receivers (eg. FS1 Smart-Plug) send a package to the smarthome system and wait for an answer.

For the teach-in reply the local ID of the item is used.
So you MUST use only one local ID per remote ID for that device type.
The binding is using addressed telegrams to communicate to the remote devices,
so you could use the same local ID for multiple remote IDs (if the remote devices evaluates the destination address, too).
